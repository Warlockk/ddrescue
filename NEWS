Changes in version 1.20:

The short name of option "--synchronous" has been changed to "-y".

The new option "-D, --odirect" has been added. This introduces a subtle
backward incompatibility because "-D" was the short name of option
"--synchronous".

The new option "--max-read-rate" has been added.

Accounting change; only bad_sector blocks are now included in "errsize".

The estimated remaining rescue time is now shown on the screen.

Times are now shown in days, hours, minutes and seconds, instead of as a
fraction of the appropriate unit.

Fill mode has been extended to write location data into each sector.

Device name is now shown with "--ask" or "-vv" on Haiku.

Ddrescuelog can now show the status of more than one logfile.

The new chapter "Optical media" has been added to the manual.

The configure option "--enable-linux" has been renamed to
"--enable-non-posix".

The targets "install-compress", "install-strip-compress",
"install-info-compress" and "install-man-compress" have been added to
the Makefile.
