Changes in version 1.0:

* A new logfile format makes multi-part rescue possible.

* The logfile is saved to disc every 30 seconds. So in case of
  a crash you can resume the rescue with little recopying.

* The logfile is now also saved in case of write error on the outfile.

* A race condition that could result in data not written to outfile but
  annotated in logfile if computer crashes at the wrong moment has been
  fixed.

* The GPL has been updated to version 2.3.
