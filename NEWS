Changes in version 1.18:

The new option "-L, --loose-domain" has been added to ddrescue and
ddrescuelog.

The new option "-N, --no-trim" has been added.

The new option "-O, --reopen-on-error" has been added.

The new options "-1, --log-rates" and "-2, --log-reads" have been added.
They produce data files usable by plotting utilities like gnuplot.

The long name of option "-r" has been changed to "--retry-passes" to
make it clear that ddrescue tries each sector only once per retry pass.

The short name of option "--generate-mode" has been changed to "-G".

If ddrescue is interrupted by a signal, it now terminates by raising the
signal received.

The algorithm of the copying phase has been changed. It now marks as
non-trimmed just the failed blocks, skips beyond them, and tries the
skipped areas later in additional passes (before trimming), reversing
the direction after each pass. The new method is faster around large
errors, keeps the logfile smaller, and produces better starting points
for trimming, which now tries the smallest blocks first.

Current total run time is now shown on the screen.

The message "About to copy an unknown number of bytes" is now shown when
the size of the input file can't be determined.

Many improvements have been made to the documentation.

The option "-B, --binary-prefixes" has been added to ddrescuelog.

The new option "-C, --complete-logfile" has been added to ddrescuelog.

"ddrescue.texinfo" has been renamed to "ddrescue.texi".
