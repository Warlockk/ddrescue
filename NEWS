Changes in version 1.23:

The new option '--same-file' has been added. It allows infile and
outfile to be the same file or device.

The new option '--shift' has been added to ddrescuelog. It shifts the
positions of all the blocks in 'mapfile' by the offset
('--output-position' - '--input-position'), and writes the resulting
mapfile to standard output.
