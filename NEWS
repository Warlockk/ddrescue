Changes in version 1.20:

The short name of option "--synchronous" has been changed to "-y".

The long name of option "-d" has been changed to "--idirect".

The new option "-D, --odirect" has been added. This introduces a subtle
backward incompatibility because "-D" was the short name of option
"--synchronous".

The new option "-J, --verify-on-error" has been added. It verifies,
after each read error, that the input device is still returning
consistent data.

The new option "--max-read-rate" has been added.

"direct disc access" now can copy arbitrary domains by reading whole
sectors and writing only the requested part.

Accounting change; only bad_sector blocks are now included in "errsize".

The estimated remaining rescue time is now shown on the screen.

Times are now shown in days, hours, minutes and seconds, instead of as a
fraction of the appropriate unit.

Fill mode has been extended to write location data into each sector.

An emergency save of the logfile has been added. It can be activated in
case of ddrescue having trouble writing the logfile.

Device name is now shown with "--ask" or "-vv" on Haiku.

Ddrescuelog can now show the status of more than one logfile.

The new chapter "Optical media" has been added to the manual.

The configure option "--enable-linux" has been renamed to
"--enable-non-posix".

The targets "install-compress", "install-strip-compress",
"install-info-compress" and "install-man-compress" have been added to
the Makefile.
