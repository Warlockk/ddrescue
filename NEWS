Changes in version 1.15:

The new option "-a, --min-read-rate" has been added.

The new option "-I, --verify-input-size" has been added.

The new option "-x, --extend-outfile" has been added.

Ddrescue now verifies that infile, outfile and logfile are all
different.

Non-tried blocks are now read aligned to cluster-size sectors.

The "split or skip" algorithm of the split pass has been improved.

A spurious warning about "-D" being ignored in fill mode has been
removed.

Ddrescuelog, a tool for manipulation, display, conversion, comparison
and testing of ddrescue logfiles, has been added.
