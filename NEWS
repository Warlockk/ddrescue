Changes in version 1.14:

The syntax of option "--max-errors" has been extended to specify new
errors (--max-errors=+N).

The short name of option "--retrim" has been changed to "-M".

A spurious warning about "preallocation not available" has been fixed.

The code implementing logfile generation has been moved to the new class
"Genbook" in preparation for the addition of the reverse mode.
