Changes in version 1.17:

The new option "-l, --logfile-size" has been added.

The option "--sector-size" has been added as a synonym of "--block-size".

The option "--retries" has been added as a synonym of "--max-retries".

The option "--size" has been added as a synonym of "--max-size".

Trimming is now done from both edges of each non-trimmed block. Largest
blocks are trimmed first.

Largest blocks are now split first until logfile reaches
"--logfile-size" entries.

Ddrescue now terminates with an error if an unexpected EOF would discard
any successfully read data, just as it does when the input file
disappears from /dev.

Ddrescue now removes the last block from the logfile if it starts at the
end of the input file and is not marked as finished. This automatically
adjusts the logfile to shrinking input devices, like CD-ROMs written in
Track-At-Once mode.

A bug has been fixed that prevented status to update after the system
clock had been put back.

Slow reads are now ignored during the first 10 seconds.

Control-C no more overwrites status message.

Generate mode no more requires the "--force" option when outfile is not
a regular file.

The new chapter "Using ddrescue safely" has been added to the manual.

The target "install-bin" has been added to the Makefile.
