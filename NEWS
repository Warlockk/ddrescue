Changes in version 1.21:

A bug in the aligment of the I/O buffer has been (hopefully) fixed.
(Thanks to Heikki Tauriainen).

Ddrescue now exits with status 1 in case of unaligned read in direct
mode (because of a wrong sector size, for example).

Ddrescue now shows all sizes in rescue mode; non-tried, non-trimmed,
non-scraped, bad-sector and finished.

The short name '-Z' has been assigned to option '--max-read-rate'.

The mapfile is now "fsync'ed" every 5 minutes because some systems seem
to never write the mapfile to disc.
