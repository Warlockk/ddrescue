Changes in version 1.13:

Non-regular output files are no more overwritten by default.

The option "--force", which forces overwriting of non-regular output
files has been added.

The option "--preallocate", which preallocates space on disc for output
file has been added.

The command line used is now written to the logfile as information for
the user.

Even more warnings have been added to the tutorial in the manual.

Revert to use "long" instead of "time_t" for time variables. Ddrescue
only needs counting seconds and "time_t" causes warnings on some
systems.
