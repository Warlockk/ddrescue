Changes in version 1.18:

The long name of option "-r" has been changed to "--retry-passes" to
make it clear that ddrescue tries each sector only once per retry pass.

The new option "-O, --reopen-on-error" has been added.

The new options "-1, --log-rates" and "-2, --log-reads" have been added.
They produce data files usable by plotting utilities like gnuplot.

The default value of option "-a, --min-read-rate" has been changed to 0
(auto).

Skip size is now reset (instead of reduced) after good data is found.
This should make ddrescue regain speed faster after leaving a bad or
slow area. If ddrescue is having difficulties skipping away from a large
area with scattered errors, or if the device has large error areas at
regular intervals, you can increase the initial skip size with
"--skip-size".

Current total run time is now shown on the screen.

The short name of option "--generate-mode" has been changed to "-G".
