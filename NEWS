Changes in version 1.24:

The new option '--command-mode' has been added. It activates a scripting
interface similar to the one of ed which reads commands from the standard
input and executes them, copying parts of the input file on demand.

It has been documented that when ddrescue finishes, the contents of any
areas marked as bad-sector remain untouched in the output file.

The configure script now accepts appending options to CXXFLAGS using the
syntax 'CXXFLAGS+=OPTIONS'.
