Changes in version 1.19:

A race condition at start of run with "--timeout=0" has been fixed.

Trimming is now done in one pass.

Splitting is now done in several passes, minimizing head movement. The
largest blocks are split first. Then each pass splits all blocks larger
than half the size of the blocks split in the previous pass. When the
size of all remaining non-split blocks drops to less than 14 sectors,
they are read sequentially. Seek direction is reversed between passes,
so that the heads never need to cross the whole disc just to begin
another pass.

The license has been changed to GPL version 2 or later.
