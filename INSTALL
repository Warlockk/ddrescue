Requirements
------------
You will need a C++ compiler.
I use gcc 3.3.5, but the code should compile with any standards compliant
compiler.
Gcc is available at http://gcc.gnu.org.


Procedure
---------
1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	bunzip2 -c ddrescue[version].tar.bz2 | tar -xf -

This creates the directory ./ddrescue[version] containing the source from
the main archive.

2. Change to ddrescue directory and run make.

	cd ddrescue[version]
	make

3. Type `make install' to install the program and the man page.
