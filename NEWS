Changes in version 1.12:

The destination file is now created with write permission for all if
umask allows it.

Files are now open in binary mode in non-POSIX platforms defining the
O_BINARY macro.

Lintian warnings in Debian about man pages have been fixed.

The "COPYING" file is no more used as data for testing.
