Changes in version 1.14:

The new option "-R, --reverse", which reverses direction of copy
operations, has been added.

The new option "-E, --max-error-rate", which stops ddrescue when the
error size grows too fast (in Bytes/s), has been added.

The syntax of option "--max-errors" has been extended to specify new
errors (--max-errors=+N).

The short name of option "--retrim" has been changed to "-M".

A spurious warning about "preallocation not available" has been fixed.
