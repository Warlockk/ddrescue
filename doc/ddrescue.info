   This manual is for GNU ddrescue (version 0.9, 28 Dec 2004).


   GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue
data in case of read errors.

   ddrescue does not truncate the output file if not asked to. So, every
time you run it on the same output file, it tries to fill in the gaps.

   The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you
don't have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log, run it
in reverse mode, etc.

   If you use the logfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very
efficiently (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt
the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point.

   Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies
of a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time,
with the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete and
error-free file. This is so because the probability of having damaged
areas at the same places on different input files is very low. Using
the logfile, only the needed blocks are read from the second and
successive copies.

Algorithm
*********

   The algorithm of ddrescue is as follows:

   1) Optionally read a starting point, a size and a list of bad blocks
(damaged areas) from the logfile, for resuming a previously interrupted
rescue.

   2) Read the non-damaged part of the input file, skipping the damaged
areas, until the requested size is reached, or until interrupted by the
user.

   3) Try to read the damaged areas, splitting them into smaller pieces
and reading the non-damaged pieces, until the hardware block size is
reached, or until interrupted by the user.

   4) Try to read the damaged hardware blocks until the specified number
of retries is reached, or until interrupted by the user.

   5) Optionally write a starting point, a size and a list of bad blocks
to the logfile for later use.

Invoking ddrescue
*****************

   The format for running ddrescue is:

     ddrescue [OPTIONS] INFILE OUTFILE [LOGFILE]

   ddrescue supports the following options:

`--help'
`-h'
     Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version number of ddrescue on the standard output and
     exit.

`--binary-prefixes'
`-B'
     Show units with binary prefixes (powers of 1024).
     SI prefixes (powers of 1000) are used by default. (See table
     below).

`--block-size=BYTES'
`-b BYTES'
     Hardware block size of input device in bytes (usually 512 for hard
     discs and floppies, and 2048 for cdroms). Defaults to 512.

`--cluster-size=BLOCKS'
`-c BLOCKS'
     Number of hardware blocks to copy at a time. Defaults to
     64KiB / hardware_block_size.

`--max-errors=N'
`-e N'
     Maximum number of error areas allowed before giving up. Defaults to
     infinity.

`--input-position=POS'
`-i POS'
     Starting position in input file. Defaults to 0.

`--no-split'
`-n'
     Do not try to split error areas. Allows a fast recovery of the
     non-damaged part of the file.

`--output-position=POS'
`-o POS'
     Starting position in output file. Defaults to `--input-position'.

`--quiet'
`-q'
     Quiet operation.

`--max-retries=N'
`-r N'
     Exit after given number of retries. -1 means infinity. Defaults to
     0.

`--max-size=BYTES'
`-s BYTES'
     Maximum size of data to be copied, in bytes.

`--truncate'
`-t'
     Truncate output file.

`--verbose'
`-v'
     Verbose mode.


   Numbers given in options (positions, sizes) may be followed by a
multiplier and an optional `B' for "byte".

   Table of SI and binary prefixes (unit multipliers):

Prefix   Value                     |   Prefix   Value
                                   |   b        hardware blocks
k        kilobyte  (10^3 = 1000)   |   Ki       kibibyte (2^10 = 1024)
M        megabyte  (10^6)          |   Mi       mebibyte (2^20)
G        gigabyte  (10^9)          |   Gi       gibibyte (2^30)
T        terabyte  (10^12)         |   Ti       tebibyte (2^40)
P        petabyte  (10^15)         |   Pi       pebibyte (2^50)
E        exabyte   (10^18)         |   Ei       exbibyte (2^60)
Z        zettabyte (10^21)         |   Zi       zebibyte (2^70)
Y        yottabyte (10^24)         |   Yi       yobibyte (2^80)

Logfile Structure
*****************

   The logfile is a text file easy to read and edit. Every line
contains 3 non-negative integers. The first of them is a position in
the input file, the second is a position in the output file, and the
third is the size (in bytes) of the data to be copied. It looks like
this:

0x0        0x0        0
0x166000   0x166000   4096
0x266E00   0x266E00   512
...        ...        ...

   The first line is special. It describes the part of the file not
tried yet, and its size may be zero. All the other lines describe
damaged areas or blocks, and their sizes can't be zero.

   If you edit the file, you may use decimal, hexadecimal or octal
values, using the same syntax that integer constants in C.
