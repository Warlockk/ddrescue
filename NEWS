Changes in version 1.19:

A race condition at start of run with "--timeout=0" has been fixed.

The new option "--ask", which asks for confirmation before starting the
copy, has been added.

Trimming is now done in one pass and may be run in reverse.

The splitting phase has been replaced by a "scraping" phase that scrapes
together the data not recovered by the copying or trimming phases.
Scraping reads each non-scraped block forwards, one sector at a time.

The long name of option "-n" has been changed to "--no-scrape".

The option "-l, --logfile-size" is no more needed and has been removed.

Model and serial number of ATA devices are shown with "--ask" or "-vv"
on Linux.

The configure script now accepts the option "--enable-linux" to enable
the compilation of linux-specific code.

The license has been changed to GPL version 2 or later.
