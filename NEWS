Changes in version 1.21:

Ddrescue now shows all sizes in rescue mode; non-tried, non-trimmed,
non-scraped, bad-sector and finished.

The short name '-Z' has been assigned to option '--max-read-rate'.

The mapfile is now "fsync'ed" every 5 minutes because some systems seem
to never write the mapfile to disc.
