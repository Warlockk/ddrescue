Changes in version 1.16:

The new option "-K, --skip-size" has been added.

The current position is now set to the end of the block when reading
backwards, allowing perfect resumability also in reverse mode.

The "-E, --max-error-rate" option now checks the rate of actually failed
reads, not the growth of error size, and shows the error rate in the
error message.

Quote characters in messages have been changed as advised by GNU Coding
Standards.

Configure option "--datadir" has been renamed to "--datarootdir" to
follow GNU Standards.
