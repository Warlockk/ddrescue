1 Introduction
**************

GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue
data in case of read errors.

   The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you
don't have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log,
restart it from a new position, etc.

   If you use the logfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very
efficiently, (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt
the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point.

   Ddrescue does not write zeros to the output when it finds bad
sectors in the input, and does not truncate the output file if not
asked to. So, every time you run it on the same output file, it tries
to fill in the gaps without wiping out the data already rescued.

   Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies
of a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time,
with the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete and
error-free file. This is so because the probability of having the same
area damaged in all copies is low. Using the logfile, only the needed
blocks are read from the second and successive copies.

   Ddrescue recommends lzip for compression of backups because the lzip
format is designed for long-term data archiving and provides data
recovery capabilities which nicely complement those of ddrescue.
(Ddrescue fills unreadable sectors with data from other copies, while
lziprecover corrects corrupt sectors with data from other copies). If
the cause of file corruption is damaged media, the combination ddrescue
+ lziprecover is the best option for recovering data from multiple
damaged copies. *Note lziprecover-example::, for an example.

   Recordable CD and DVD media keep their data only for a finite time
(typically for many years). After that time, data loss develops slowly
with read errors growing from the outer media region towards the inside.
Just make two (or more) copies of every important CD/DVD you burn so
that you can later recover them with ddrescue.

   Because ddrescue needs to read and write at random places, it only
works on seekable (random access) input and output files.

   If your system supports it, ddrescue can use direct disc access to
read the input file, bypassing the kernel cache.

   Ddrescue also features a "fill mode" able to selectively overwrite
parts of the output file, which has a number of interesting uses like
wiping data, marking bad areas or even, in some cases, "repair" damaged
sectors.

2 Basic concepts
****************

Block
     Any amount of data. A block is described by its starting position
     and its size.

Cluster
     Group of consecutive sectors read or written in one go.

Device
     Piece of hardware containing data. Hard disc drives, cdrom drives,
     USB pendrives, are devices. /dev/hda, /dev/sdb, are device names.

File
     Files are named units of data which are stored by the operating
     system for you to retrieve later by name. Devices and partitions
     are accessed by means of their associated file names.

Partition
     Every part in which a device is divided. A partition normally
     contains a file system. /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb3, are partition names.

Recoverable formats
     As ddrescue uses standard library functions to read data from the
     device being rescued, only mountable device formats can be rescued
     with ddrescue. DVDs can be mounted and they can be rescued,
     "compact disc digital audio" CDs can't, "video CDs"[1] maybe.
     [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD

Rescue domain
     Block or set of blocks to be acted upon (rescued, listed, etc).
     You can define it with the options `--input-position', `--size' and
     `--domain-logfile'. The rescue domain defaults to the whole input
     file or logfile.

Sector
     Hardware block. Smallest accessible amount of data on a device.

3 Using ddrescue safely
***********************

Ddrescue is like any other power tool. You need to understand what it
does, and you need to understand some things about the machines it does
those things to, in order to use it safely.

   Always use a logfile unless you know you won't need it. Without a
logfile, ddrescue can't resume a rescue, only reinitiate it.

   Never try to rescue a r/w mounted partition. The resulting copy may
be useless.

   Never try to repair a file system on a drive with I/O errors; you
will probably lose even more data.

   If you use a device or a partition as destination, any data stored
there will be overwritten.

   Some systems may change device names on reboot (eg. udev enabled
systems). If you reboot, check the device names before restarting
ddrescue.

   If you interrupt the rescue and then reboot, any partially copied
partitions should be hidden before allowing them to be touched by any
operating system that tries to mount and "fix" the partitions it sees.

4 Algorithm
***********

GNU ddrescue is not a derivative of dd, nor is related to dd in any way
except in that both can be used for copying data from one device to
another. The difference is that ddrescue uses a sophisticated algorithm
to copy data from failing drives causing them as little additional
damage as possible.

   Ddrescue manages efficiently the status of the rescue in progress and
tries to rescue the good parts first, scheduling reads inside bad (or
slow) areas for later. This maximizes the amount of data that can be
finally recovered from a failing drive.

   The standard dd utility can be used to save data from a failing
drive, but it reads the data sequentially, which may wear out the drive
without rescuing anything if the errors are at the beginning of the
drive.

   Other programs read the data sequentially but switch to small size
reads when they find errors. This is a bad idea because it means
spending more time at error areas, damaging the surface, the heads and
the drive mechanics, instead of getting out of them as fast as
possible. This behavior reduces the chances of rescuing the remaining
good data.

   The algorithm of ddrescue is as follows (the user may interrupt the
process at any point, but be aware that a bad drive can block ddrescue
for a long time until the kernel gives up):

   1) Optionally read a logfile describing the status of a multi-part or
previously interrupted rescue. If no logfile is specified or is empty or
does not exist, mark all the rescue domain as non-tried.

   2) (First phase; Copying) Read the non-tried parts of the input file,
marking the failed blocks as non-trimmed and skipping beyond them, until
all the rescue domain is tried. Slow areas are also skipped and tried
later in additional passes (before trimming). Only non-tried areas are
read in large blocks. Trimming, splitting and retrying are done sector
by sector. Each sector is tried at most two times; the first in this
step as part of a large block read, the second in one of the steps below
as a single sector read.

   3) (Second phase; Trimming) Read forwards one sector at a time from
the leading edge of the largest non-trimmed block, until a bad sector is
found. Then read backwards one sector at a time from the trailing edge
of the same block, until a bad sector is found. For each non-trimmed
block, mark the bad sectors found as bad-sector and mark the rest of
that block as non-split. Repeat until there are no more non-trimmed
blocks.

   4) (Third phase; Splitting) Read forwards one sector at a time from
the center of the largest non-split block, until a bad sector is found.
Then, if the bad sector found is not the first one tried, read backwards
one sector at a time from the center of the same block, until a bad
sector is found. If the logfile is larger than `--logfile-size', read
the smallest non-split blocks until the number of entries in the
logfile drops below `--logfile-size'. Repeat until all remaining
non-split blocks have less than 5 sectors. Then read the remaining
non-split blocks sequentially.

   5) (Fourth phase; Retrying) Optionally try to read again the bad
sectors until the specified number of retry passes is reached. Every
bad sector is tried only once in each pass.

   6) Optionally write a logfile for later use.


   Note that as ddrescue splits the failed blocks, making them smaller,
the total error size may diminish while the number of errors increases.

   The logfile is periodically saved to disc, as well as when ddrescue
finishes or is interrupted. So in case of a crash you can resume the
rescue with little recopying.

   Also, the same logfile can be used for multiple commands that copy
different areas of the input file, and for multiple recovery attempts
over different subsets. See this example:

Rescue the most important part of the disc first.
     ddrescue -i0 -s50MiB /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
     ddrescue -i0 -s1MiB -d -r3 /dev/hdc hdimage logfile

Then rescue some key disc areas.
     ddrescue -i30GiB -s10GiB /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
     ddrescue -i230GiB -s5GiB /dev/hdc hdimage logfile

Now rescue the rest (does not recopy what is already done).
     ddrescue /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
     ddrescue -d -r3 /dev/hdc hdimage logfile

5 Invoking ddrescue
*******************

The format for running ddrescue is:

     ddrescue [OPTIONS] INFILE OUTFILE [LOGFILE]

   ddrescue supports the following options:

`-h'
`--help'
     Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

`-V'
`--version'
     Print the version number of ddrescue on the standard output and
     exit.

`-a BYTES'
`--min-read-rate=BYTES'
     Minimum read rate of good non-tried areas, in bytes per second. If
     the read rate falls below this value, ddrescue will skip ahead a
     variable amount depending on rate and error histories. The skipped
     blocks are tried in additional passes (before trimming) where the
     minimum read rate is divided by ten before each pass, until there
     are no more non-tried blocks left.

     If BYTES is 0 (auto), the minimum read rate is recalculated for
     each block as (average_rate / 10). If BYTES is -1, skipping over
     slow areas is disabled. Values above device capabilities will be
     ignored.

`-A'
`--try-again'
     Mark all non-split and non-trimmed blocks inside the rescue domain
     as non-tried before beginning the rescue. Try this if the drive
     stops responding and ddrescue immediately starts splitting failed
     blocks when restarted. If `--retrim' is also specified, mark all
     failed blocks inside the rescue domain as non-tried.

`-b BYTES'
`--sector-size=BYTES'
     Sector (hardware block) size of input device in bytes (usually 512
     for hard discs and 3.5" floppies, 1024 for 5.25" floppies, and
     2048 for cdroms). Defaults to 512.

`-B'
`--binary-prefixes'
     Show units with binary prefixes (powers of 1024).
     SI prefixes (powers of 1000) are used by default. (See table
     below).

`-c SECTORS'
`--cluster-size=SECTORS'
     Number of sectors to copy at a time. Defaults to
     64 KiB / sector_size.  Try smaller values for slow drives. The
     number of sectors per track (18 or 9) is a good value for floppies.

`-C'
`--complete-only'
     Limit rescue domain to the blocks listed in the LOGFILE. Do not
     read new data beyond LOGFILE limits. This is useful when reading
     from devices of undefined size (like raw devices), when the drive
     returns an incorrect size, or when reading from a partial copy. It
     can only be used after a first rescue attempt, possibly limited
     with the `--size' option, has produced a complete LOGFILE.

`-d'
`--direct'
     Use direct disc access to read from INFILE, bypassing the kernel
     cache. (Open the file with the O_DIRECT flag). Use it only on
     devices or partitions, not on regular files. Sector size must be
     correctly set for this to work. Not all systems support this.

     If your system does not support direct disc access, ddrescue will
     warn you. If the sector size is not correctly set, all reads will
     result in errors, and no data will be rescued.

`-D'
`--synchronous'
     Use synchronous writes for OUTFILE. (Issue a fsync call after
     every write). May be useful when forcing the drive to remap its bad
     sectors.

`-e [+]N'
`--max-errors=[+]N'
     Maximum number of error areas allowed before giving up. Defaults to
     infinity. If N is preceded by `+' the number refers to new error
     areas found in this run, not counting those already annotated in
     the LOGFILE.

`-E BYTES'
`--max-error-rate=BYTES'
     Maximum rate of errors allowed before giving up, in bytes per
     second.  Defaults to infinity. The rate being measured is that of
     actually failed reads, so the rescue may finish because of this
     rate being exceeded even if the total error size (errsize) does
     not change because the areas being tried are already marked as
     errors.

`-f'
`--force'
     Force overwrite of OUTFILE. Needed when OUTFILE is not a regular
     file, but a device or partition.

`-F TYPES'
`--fill-mode=TYPES'
     Fill the blocks in OUTFILE specified as any of TYPES in LOGFILE,
     with data read from INFILE. TYPES contains one or more of the
     status characters defined in the chapter Logfile Structure (*note
     Logfile structure::). See the chapter Fill mode (*note Fill
     mode::) for a complete description of the fill mode.

`-G'
`--generate-mode'
     Generate an approximate LOGFILE from the INFILE and OUTFILE of the
     original rescue run. Note that you must keep the original offset
     between `--input-position' and `--output-position' of the original
     rescue run. See the chapter Generate mode (*note Generate mode::)
     for a complete description of the generate mode.

`-i BYTES'
`--input-position=BYTES'
     Starting position in INFILE, in bytes. Defaults to 0. In fill mode
     it refers to a position in the INFILE of the original rescue run.
     See the chapter Fill mode (*note Fill mode::) for details.

`-I'
`--verify-input-size'
     Compare the size of INFILE with the size calculated from the list
     of blocks contained in the LOGFILE, and exit with status 1 if they
     differ. This is not enabled by default because the size of some
     devices can't be known in advance and because the size derived
     from the LOGFILE may be incomplete, for example after doing a
     partial rescue.

`-K BYTES'
`--skip-size=BYTES'
     Set the initial size to skip on the first read error or slow read.
     The value given will be rounded to the next multiple of sector
     size. The skip size will be doubled for each read error or slow
     read until it reaches 1% of the size of INFILE or 1 GiB (whichever
     is smaller), and reset when good data is found. If ddrescue is
     having difficulties skipping away from a large area with scattered
     errors, or if the device has large error areas at regular
     intervals, you can increase the initial skip size with this
     option. Valid values range from 64 KiB to 1 GiB.  Defaults to 64
     KiB.

`-l ENTRIES'
`--logfile-size=ENTRIES'
     During the splitting phase, do not grow logfile beyond this number
     of entries. Logfile may be larger if it was larger at startup or
     if it became larger during the copying or trimming phases.
     Defaults to 1000.  (Each entry is about 26-30 bytes in size).

`-m FILE'
`--domain-logfile=FILE'
     Restrict the rescue domain to the blocks marked as finished in the
     logfile FILE. This is useful if the destination drive fails during
     the rescue.

`-M'
`--retrim'
     Mark all failed blocks inside the rescue domain as non-trimmed
     before beginning the rescue. The effect is similar to
     `--retry-passes=1', but the bad sectors are tried in a different
     order, making perhaps possible to rescue some of them.

`-n'
`--no-split'
     Skip the splitting phase. Avoids spending a lot of time trying to
     rescue the most difficult parts of the file.

`-o BYTES'
`--output-position=BYTES'
     Starting position in OUTFILE, in bytes. Defaults to
     `--input-position'. The bytes below BYTES aren't touched if they
     exist and truncation is not requested. Else they are set to 0.

`-O'
`--reopen-on-error'
     Close the input file and then reopen it after every read error or
     slow read encountered during the copying phase (i.e., every time
     it skips ahead). Use this option if you notice a permanent drop in
     transfer rate after finding read errors. Most probably the
     slowing-down is intentionally caused by the kernel trying to
     increase the probability of reading data from the device.

`-p'
`--preallocate'
     Preallocate space on disc for OUTFILE. Only space for regular
     files can be preallocated. If preallocation succeeds, rescue will
     not fail due to lack of free space on disc. If ddrescue can't
     determine the size to preallocate, you may need to specify it with
     some combination of the `--input-position', `--output-position',
     `--size', and `--domain-logfile' options.

`-q'
`--quiet'
     Quiet operation. Suppress all messages.

`-r N'
`--retry-passes=N'
     Exit after given number of retry passes. Defaults to 0. -1 means
     infinity. Every bad sector is tried only once in each pass. To
     retry bad sectors detected on a previous run, you must specify a
     non-zero number of retry passes.

`-R'
`--reverse'
     Reverse direction of copying, retrying, and the sequential part of
     splitting, running them backwards from the end of the input file.

`-s BYTES'
`--size=BYTES'
     Maximum size of the input data to be copied, in bytes. If ddrescue
     can't determine the size of the input device, you may need to
     specify it with this option. Note that this option specifies the
     size of the input data to be copied, not the size of the resulting
     OUTFILE. So, for example, the following command creates an OUTFILE
     300 bytes long, but only writes data on the last 200 bytes:

          ddrescue -i 100 -s 200 infile outfile logfile

`-S'
`--sparse'
     Use sparse writes for OUTFILE. (The blocks of zeros are not
     actually allocated on disc). May save a lot of disc space in some
     cases.  Not all systems support this. Only regular files can be
     sparse.

`-t'
`--truncate'
     Truncate OUTFILE to zero size before writing to it. Only works for
     regular files, not for drives or partitions.

`-T INTERVAL'
`--timeout=INTERVAL'
     Maximum time since last successful read allowed before giving up.
     Defaults to infinity. INTERVAL is a rational number (like 1.5 or
     1/2) optionally followed by one of `s', `m', `h' or `d', meaning
     seconds, minutes, hours and days respectively. If no unit is
     specified, it defaults to seconds.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Verbose mode. Further -v's (up to 4) increase the verbosity level.

`-w'
`--ignore-write-errors'
     Make fill mode ignore write errors. This is useful to avoid
     ddrescue exiting because of new errors developing while wiping the
     good sectors of a failing drive. Fill mode normally writes to
     OUTFILE one cluster at a time. With this option, after the first
     write error is found in an area, the rest of that area is filled
     sector by sector.

`-x BYTES'
`--extend-outfile=BYTES'
     Extend the size of OUTFILE to make it at least BYTES long.  If the
     size of OUTFILE is already equal or longer than BYTES then this
     option does nothing. Use this option to guarantee a minimum size
     for OUTFILE. Only regular files can be extended.

`-1 FILE'
`--log-rates=FILE'
     Log rates and error sizes every second in FILE. Every time the
     screen is updated with new details, some of those details (time,
     input position, current and average rates, number of errors and
     error size) are written to FILE in a format usable by plotting
     utilities like gnuplot. This allows a posterior analysis of the
     drive to see if it has any weak zones (areas where the transfer
     rate drops well below the sustained average).

`-2 FILE'
`--log-reads=FILE'
     Log all read operations in FILE. Every read attempt and its result
     (position, size, copied size and error size) is written to FILE. A
     line is also written at the beginning of each phase (copying,
     trimming, splitting and retrying). Finally, a line with a time
     mark is written every second (unless the read takes more time).
     Use this option with caution because FILE may become very large
     very quickly.


   Numbers given as arguments to options (positions, sizes, rates, etc)
may be followed by a multiplier and an optional `B' for "byte".

   Table of SI and binary prefixes (unit multipliers):

Prefix   Value                     |   Prefix   Value
                                   |   s        sectors
k        kilobyte  (10^3 = 1000)   |   Ki       kibibyte (2^10 = 1024)
M        megabyte  (10^6)          |   Mi       mebibyte (2^20)
G        gigabyte  (10^9)          |   Gi       gibibyte (2^30)
T        terabyte  (10^12)         |   Ti       tebibyte (2^40)
P        petabyte  (10^15)         |   Pi       pebibyte (2^50)
E        exabyte   (10^18)         |   Ei       exbibyte (2^60)
Z        zettabyte (10^21)         |   Zi       zebibyte (2^70)
Y        yottabyte (10^24)         |   Yi       yobibyte (2^80)


   Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or
invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (eg, bug) which
caused ddrescue to panic.

6 Logfile structure
*******************

The logfile is a text file easy to read and edit. It is formed by three
parts, the heading comments, the status line, and the list of data
blocks. Any line beginning with `#' is a comment line.

   NOTE: Logfiles generated by a version of ddrescue prior to 1.6 lack
the status line. If you want to use an old logfile with ddrescue 1.6 or
later, you will have to insert a line like `0 +' at the beginning of
the logfile.

   The heading comments contain the version of ddrescue and the command
line used to create the logfile. They are intended as information for
the user.

   The first non-comment line is the status line. It contains a
non-negative integer and a status character. The integer is the position
being tried in the input file. The status character is one of these:

Character   Meaning
'?'         copying non-tried blocks
'*'         trimming non-trimmed blocks
'/'         splitting non-split blocks
'-'         retrying bad sectors
'F'         filling specified blocks
'G'         generating approximate logfile
'+'         finished

   The blocks in the list of data blocks must be contiguous and
non-overlapping.

   Every line in the list of data blocks describes a block of data. It
contains 2 non-negative integers and a status character. The first
integer is the starting position of the block in the input file, the
second integer is the size (in bytes) of the block. The status character
is one of these:

Character   Meaning
'?'         non-tried block
'*'         failed block non-trimmed
'/'         failed block non-split
'-'         failed block bad-sector(s)
'+'         finished block

And here is an example logfile:

# Rescue Logfile. Created by GNU ddrescue version 1.18-pre4
# Command line: ddrescue /dev/fd0 fdimage logfile
# current_pos  current_status
0x00120000     ?
#      pos         size   status

7 A small tutorial with examples
********************************

This tutorial is for those already able to use the dd command. If you
don't know what dd is, better search the net for some introductory
material about dd and GNU ddrescue first.

   A failing drive tends to develop more and more errors as time passes.
Because of this, you should rescue the data from a drive as soon as you
notice the first error. Be diligent because every time a physically
damaged drive powers up and is able to output some data, it may be the
very last time that it ever will.

   You should make a copy of the failing drive with ddrescue, and then
try to repair the copy. If your data is really important, use the first
copy as a master for a second copy, and try to repair the second copy.
If something goes wrong, you have the master intact to try again.

   If you are trying to rescue a whole partition, first repair the copy
with e2fsck or some other tool appropiate for the type of partition you
are trying to rescue, then mount the repaired copy somewhere and try to
recover the files in it.

   If the drive is so damaged that the file system in the rescued
partition can't be repaired or mounted, you will have to browse the
rescued data with an hex editor and extract the desired parts by hand
or use a file recovery tool like photorec.

   If the partition table is damaged, you may try to rescue the whole
disc, then try to repair the partition table and the partitions on the
copy.

   If the damaged drive is not listed in /dev, then you cannot rescue
it.  At least not with ddrescue.


Example 1: Rescue a whole disc with two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to
/dev/hdb.
Note: you do not need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand, but if the
partition table on /dev/hda is damaged, you'll need to recreate it
somehow on /dev/hdb.

     ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
     ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
     fdisk /dev/hdb
     e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdb1
     e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdb2


Example 2: Rescue an ext2 partition in /dev/hda2 to /dev/hdb2.
Note: you need to create the hdb2 partition with fdisk first. hdb2
should be of appropiate type and size.

     ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 logfile
     ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 logfile
     e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdb2
     mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hdb2 /mnt
       (read rescued files from /mnt)


Example 3: Rescue a CD-ROM in /dev/cdrom.

     ddrescue -n -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage logfile
     ddrescue -d -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage logfile
       (write cdimage to a blank CD-ROM)


Example 4: Rescue a CD-ROM in /dev/cdrom from two copies.

     ddrescue -n -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage logfile
     ddrescue -d -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage logfile
       (insert second copy in the CD drive)
     ddrescue -d -r1 -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage logfile
       (write cdimage to a blank CD-ROM)


Example 5: Rescue a lzip compressed backup from two copies on CD-ROM
with error-checked merging of copies (*Note lziprecover manual:
(lziprecover)Top, for details about lziprecover).

     ddrescue -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage1 logfile1
     mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro cdimage1 /mnt/cdimage
     cp /mnt/cdimage/backup.tar.lz rescued1.tar.lz
     umount /mnt/cdimage
       (insert second copy in the CD drive)
     ddrescue -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage2 logfile2
     mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro cdimage2 /mnt/cdimage
     cp /mnt/cdimage/backup.tar.lz rescued2.tar.lz
     umount /mnt/cdimage
     lziprecover -m -v -o backup.tar.lz rescued1.tar.lz rescued2.tar.lz


Example 6: While rescuing the whole drive /dev/hda to /dev/hdb, /dev/hda
freezes up at position 12345678.

     ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile       <-- /dev/hda freezes here
       (restart /dev/hda or reboot computer)
       (restart copy at a safe distance from the troubled sector)
     ddrescue -f -i 12350000 /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
       (copy backwards down to the troubled sector)
     ddrescue -f -R /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile


Example 7: While rescuing the whole drive /dev/hda to /dev/hdb, /dev/hdb
fails and you have to rescue data to a third drive, /dev/hdc.

     ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile1     <-- /dev/hdb fails here
     ddrescue -f -m logfile1 /dev/hdb /dev/hdc logfile2
     ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdc logfile2
     ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda /dev/hdc logfile2


Example 8: While rescuing the whole drive /dev/hda to /dev/hdb, /dev/hda
stops responding and disappears from /dev.

     ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile      <-- /dev/hda fails here
       (restart /dev/hda or reboot computer as many times as needed)
     ddrescue -f -n -A /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
     ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile

8 Direct disc access
********************

If you notice that the positions and sizes in the logfile are ALWAYS
multiples of the sector size, maybe your kernel is caching the disc
accesses and grouping them. In this case you may want to use direct disc
access or a raw device to bypass the kernel cache and rescue more of
your data.

   NOTE! Sector size must be correctly set with the `--sector-size'
option for this to work. Only whole sectors can be read; both
`--input-position' and `--size' must be a multiple of sector size.

   Try the `--direct' option first. If direct disc access is not
available in your system, try raw devices. Read your system
documentation to find how to bind a raw device to a regular block
device. Some OSs provide raw access through special device names, like
/dev/rdisk.

   Ddrescue aligns its I/O buffer to the sector size so that it can be
used for direct disc access or to read from raw devices. For efficiency
reasons, also aligns it to the memory page size if page size is a
multiple of sector size. On some systems, ddrescue can't determine the
size of a raw device, so an explicit `--size' or `--complete-only'
option may be needed.

   Using direct disc access, or reading from a raw device, may be
slower or faster than normal cached reading depending on your OS and
hardware. In case it is slower you may want to make a first pass using
normal cached reads and use direct disc access, or a raw device, only
to recover the good sectors inside the failed blocks.


Example 1: using direct disc access.

     ddrescue -f -n /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 logfile
     ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 logfile
     e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdc1
     mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hdc1 /mnt


Example 2: using a raw device.

     raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hdb1
     ddrescue -f -n /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 logfile
     ddrescue -C -f -r3 /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hdc1 logfile
     raw /dev/raw/raw1 0 0
     e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdc1
     mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hdc1 /mnt


File: ddrescue.info,  Node: Fill mode,  Next: Generate mode,  Prev: Direct disc access,  Up: Top

9 Fill mode
***********

When ddrescue is invoked with the `--fill-mode' option it operates in
"fill mode", which is different from the default "rescue mode". That
is, if you use the `--fill-mode' option, ddrescue does not rescue
anything. It only fills with data read from the input file the blocks of
the output file whose status character from the logfile coincides with
one of the type characters specified as argument to the `--fill-mode'
option.

   In fill mode the input file may have any size. If it is too small,
the data will be duplicated as many times as necessary to fill the input
buffer. If it is too big, only the data needed to fill the input buffer
will be read. Then the same data will be written to every cluster or
sector to be filled.

   Note that in fill mode the input file is always read from position
0. If you specify a `--input-position', it refers to the original input
file from which the logfile was built, and is only used to calculate the
offset between input and output positions.

   Note also that when filling the input file of the original rescue run
you should set `--input-position' and `--output-position' to identical
values, whereas when filling the output file of the original rescue run
you should keep the original offset between `--input-position' and
`--output-position'.

   The `--fill-mode' option implies the `--complete-only' option.

   In fill mode the logfile is updated to allow resumability when
interrupted or in case of a crash, but as nothing is being rescued the
logfile is not destroyed. The status line is the only part of the
logfile that is modified.


The fill mode has a number of uses. See the following examples:

Example 1: Mark parts of the rescued copy to allow finding them when
examined in an hex editor. For example, the following command line fills
all blocks marked as `-' (bad-sector) with copies of the string
`BAD SECTOR ':

     printf "BAD SECTOR " > tmpfile
     ddrescue --fill-mode=- tmpfile outfile logfile

Example 2: Wipe only the good sectors, leaving the bad sectors alone.
This way, the drive will still test bad (i.e., with unreadable sectors).
This is the fastest way of wiping a failing drive, and is specially
useful when sending the drive back to the manufacturer for warranty
replacement.

     ddrescue --fill-mode=+ --force /dev/zero bad_drive logfile

Example 3: Force the drive to remap the bad sectors, making it usable
again. If the drive has only a few bad sectors, and they are not caused
by drive age, you can probably just rewrite those sectors, and the drive
will reallocate them automatically to new "spare" sectors that it keeps
for just this purpose. WARNING! This may not work on your drive.

     ddrescue --fill-mode=- --force --synchronous /dev/zero bad_drive logfile


Fill mode can also help you to figure out, independently of the file
system used, what files are partially or entirely in the bad areas of
the disc. Just follow these steps:

   1) Copy the damaged drive with ddrescue until finished. Do not use
sparse writes. This yields a logfile with only finished (`+') and
bad-sector (`-') blocks.

   2) Fill the bad-sector blocks of the copied drive or image file with
a string not present in any file, for example "DEADBEEF".

   3) Mount the copied drive (or the image file, via loopback device).

   4) Grep for the fill string in all the files. Those files containing
the string reside (at least partially) in damaged disc areas.

   5) Unmount the copied drive or image file.

   6) Optionally fill the bad-sector blocks of the copied drive or image
file with zeros to restore the disc image.

Example 4: Figure out what files are in the bad areas of the disc.

     ddrescue -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage logfile
     printf "DEADBEEF" > tmpfile
     ddrescue --fill-mode=- tmpfile cdimage logfile
     rm tmpfile
     mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro cdimage /mnt/cdimage
     find /mnt/cdimage -type f -exec grep "DEADBEEF" '{}' ';'
     umount /mnt/cdimage
     ddrescue --fill-mode=- /dev/zero cdimage logfile

10 Generate mode
****************

NOTE: When ddrescue is invoked with the `--generate-mode' option it
operates in "generate mode", which is different from the default "rescue
mode". That is, if you use the `--generate-mode' option, ddrescue does
not rescue anything. It only tries to generate a logfile for later use.

   So you didn't read the tutorial and started ddrescue without a
logfile.  Now, two days later, your computer crashed and you can't know
how much data ddrescue managed to save. And even worse, you can't
resume the rescue; you have to restart it from the very beginning.

   Or maybe you started copying a drive with `dd conv=noerror,sync' and
are now in the same situation described above.  In this case, note that
you can't use a copy made by dd unless it was invoked with the `sync'
conversion argument.

   Don't despair (yet). Ddrescue can in some cases generate an
approximate logfile, from the input file and the (partial) copy, that
is almost as good as an exact logfile. It makes this by simply assuming
that sectors containing all zeros were not rescued.

   However, if the destination of the copy was a drive or a partition,
(or an existing regular file and truncation was not requested), most
probably you will need to restart ddrescue from the very beginning.
(This time with a logfile, of course). The reason is that old data may
be present in the drive that have not been overwritten yet, and may be
thus non-tried but non-zero.

   For example, if you first tried one of these commands:
     ddrescue infile outfile
     or
     dd if=infile of=outfile conv=noerror,sync

   then you can generate an approximate logfile with this command:
     ddrescue --generate-mode infile outfile logfile

Note that you must keep the original offset between `--input-position'
and `--output-position' of the original rescue run.

11 Ddrescuelog
**************

Ddrescuelog is a tool that manipulates ddrescue logfiles, shows logfile
contents, converts logfiles to/from other formats, compares logfiles,
tests rescue status, and can delete a logfile if the rescue is done.
Ddrescuelog operations can be restricted to one or several parts of the
logfile if the domain setting options are used.

   Here are some examples of how to use ddrescuelog, alone or in
combination with other tools.


Example 1: Delete the logfile if the rescue is finished (all data is
recovered without errors left).

     ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
     ddrescuelog -d logfile


Example 2: Rescue two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to /dev/hdb and
repair the file systems using badblock lists generated with
ddrescuelog. File system block size is 4096.
Note: you do need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand.

     fdisk /dev/hdb                                <-- partition /deb/hdb
     ddrescue -f /dev/hda1 /dev/hdb1 logfile1
     ddrescue -f /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 logfile2
     ddrescuelog -l- -b4096 logfile1 > badblocks1
     ddrescuelog -l- -b4096 logfile2 > badblocks2
     e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks1 /dev/hdb1
     e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks2 /dev/hdb2


Example 3: Rescue a whole disc with two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to
/dev/hdb and repair the file systems using badblock lists generated with
ddrescuelog. Disc sector size is 512, file system block size is 4096.
Arguments to options `-i' and `-s' are the starting positions and sizes
of the partitions being rescued.
Note: you do not need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand, but if the
partition table on /dev/hda is damaged, you'll need to recreate it
somehow on /dev/hdb.

     ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
     fdisk /dev/hdb                                <-- get partition sizes
     ddrescuelog -l- -b512 -i63b -o0 -s9767457b -b4096 logfile > badblocks1
     ddrescuelog -l- -b512 -i9767520b -o0 -s128520b -b4096 logfile > badblocks2
     e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks1 /dev/hdb1
     e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks2 /dev/hdb2

12 Invoking ddrescuelog
***********************

The format for running ddrescuelog is:

     ddrescuelog [OPTIONS] LOGFILE

   Ddrescuelog supports the following options:

`-h'
`--help'
     Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

`-V'
`--version'
     Print the version number of ddrescuelog on the standard output and
     exit.

`-a OLD_TYPES,NEW_TYPES'
`--change-types=OLD_TYPES,NEW_TYPES'
     Change the status of every block in the rescue domain from one
     type in OLD_TYPES to the corresponding type in NEW_TYPES, much like
     the `tr' command does, and write the resulting logfile to standard
     output. OLD_TYPES and NEW_TYPES are strings of block status
     characters as defined in the chapter Logfile structure (*note
     Logfile structure::). Blocks whose status is not in OLD_TYPES are
     left unchanged. If NEW_TYPES is shorter than OLD_TYPES the last
     type of NEW_TYPES is repeated as many times as necessary.

`-b BYTES'
`--block-size=BYTES'
     Block size used by ddrescuelog. Depending on the requested
     operation it may be the sector size of the input device, the block
     size of the rescued file system, etc. Defaults to 512.

`-c[TYPE1TYPE2]'
`--create-logfile[=TYPE1TYPE2]'
     Create a logfile from a list of block numbers read from standard
     input.  Only blocks included in the rescue domain will be added to
     LOGFILE.

     TYPE1 and TYPE2 are block status characters as defined in the
     chapter Logfile structure (*note Logfile structure::). TYPE1 sets
     the type for blocks included in the list, while TYPE2 sets the
     type for the rest of the logfile. If not specified, TYPE1 defaults
     to `+' and TYPE2 defaults to `-'.

`-d'
`--delete-if-done'
     Delete the given LOGFILE if all the blocks in the rescue domain
     have been successfuly recovered. The exit status is 0 if LOGFILE
     could be deleted, 1 otherwise.

`-D'
`--done-status'
     Test if all the blocks in the rescue domain have been successfuly
     recovered. The exit status is 0 if all tested blocks are finished,
     1 otherwise.

`-f'
`--force'
     Force overwrite of LOGFILE.

`-i BYTES'
`--input-position=BYTES'
     Starting position of the rescue domain, in bytes. Defaults to 0. It
     refers to a position in the original input file.

`-l TYPES'
`--list-blocks=TYPES'
     Print on standard output the block numbers of the blocks specified
     as any of TYPES in LOGFILE and included in the rescue domain.
     TYPES contains one or more of the block status characters defined
     in the chapter Logfile structure (*note Logfile structure::).

     The list format is one block number per line in decimal, like the
     output of the badblocks program, so that it can be used as input
     for e2fsck or other similar filesystem repairing tool.

`-m FILE'
`--domain-logfile=FILE'
     Restrict the rescue domain to the blocks marked as finished in the
     logfile FILE.

`-n'
`--invert-logfile'
     Invert the types of the blocks in LOGFILE which are included in
     the rescue domain, and write the resulting logfile to standard
     output.  Finished blocks (`+') are changed to bad-sector (`-'), all
     other types are changed to finished. `--invert-logfile' is
     equivalent to `--change-types=?*/-+,++++-'

`-o BYTES'
`--output-position=BYTES'
     Starting position in output file, in bytes. Is used by the
     `--list-blocks' option. Defaults to `--input-position'.

`-p FILE'
`--compare-logfile=FILE'
     Compare the types of the blocks included in the rescue domain. The
     exit status is 0 if all tested blocks are the same in both files, 1
     otherwise.

`-q'
`--quiet'
     Quiet operation. Suppress all messages.

`-s BYTES'
`--size=BYTES'
     Maximum size of the rescue domain, in bytes. It refers to a size
     in the original input file.

`-t'
`--show-status'
     Print a summary of LOGFILE contents on the standard output. The
     summary can be restricted to one or several parts of LOGFILE if
     the domain setting options are used.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Verbose mode. Further -v's (up to 4) increase the verbosity level.

`-x FILE'
`--xor-logfile=FILE'
     Perform a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation between the finished
     blocks in FILE and those in LOGFILE, and write the resulting
     logfile to standard output. In other words, in the resulting
     logfile a block is only shown as finished if it was finished in
     either of the two input logfiles but not in both.

`-y FILE'
`--and-logfile=FILE'
     Perform a logical AND operation between the finished blocks in
     FILE and those in LOGFILE, and write the resulting logfile to
     standard output. In other words, in the resulting logfile a block
     is only shown as finished if it was finished in both input
     logfiles.

`-z FILE'
`--or-logfile=FILE'
     Perform a logical OR operation between the finished blocks in FILE
     and those in LOGFILE, and write the resulting logfile to standard
     output. In other words, in the resulting logfile a block is shown
     as finished if it was finished in either of the two input logfiles.


   Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or
invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (eg, bug) which
caused ddrescuelog to panic.
