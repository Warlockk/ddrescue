Changes in version 1.19:

A race condition at start of run with "--timeout=0" has been fixed.

Trimming is now done in one pass and may be run in reverse.

The splitting phase has been replaced by a "scraping" phase that scrapes
together the data not recovered by the copying or trimming phases.
Scraping reads each non-scraped block forwards, one sector at a time.

The option '-l, --logfile-size' is no more needed and has been removed.

The license has been changed to GPL version 2 or later.
