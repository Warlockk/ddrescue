Changes in version 1.18:

The new option "-L, --loose-domain" has been added to ddrescue and
ddrescuelog.

The new option "-N, --no-trim" has been added.

The new option "-O, --reopen-on-error" has been added.

The new options "-1, --log-rates" and "-2, --log-reads" have been added.
They produce data files usable by plotting utilities like gnuplot.

The long name of option "-r" has been changed to "--retry-passes" to
make it clear that ddrescue tries each sector only once per retry pass.

Skip size is now reset (instead of reduced) after good data is found.
This should make ddrescue regain speed faster after leaving a bad or
slow area. If ddrescue is having difficulties skipping away from a large
area with scattered errors, or if the device has large error areas at
regular intervals, you can increase the initial skip size with
"--skip-size".

Current total run time is now shown on the screen.

The short name of option "--generate-mode" has been changed to "-G".

The option "-B, --binary-prefixes" has been added to ddrescuelog.

The new option "-C, --complete-logfile" has been added to ddrescuelog.

"ddrescue.texinfo" has been renamed to "ddrescue.texi".
