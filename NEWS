Changes in version 1.21:

A bug in the alignment of the I/O buffer has been (hopefully) fixed.
(Thanks to Heikki Tauriainen).

Ddrescue now exits with status 1 in case of unaligned read in direct
mode (because of a wrong sector size, for example).

Short option names '-1' and '-2' have been removed to avoid mistakes in
the command line.

Only regular files are now allowed as arguments of options '--log-rates'
and '--log-reads'.

Option '-D, --odirect' now works also in fill mode.

Option '-J, --verify-on-error' now exits with status 1 if a read error
happens before a good sector is found.

The short name '-Z' has been assigned to option '--max-read-rate'.

Ddrescue now shows all sizes in rescue mode; non-tried, non-trimmed,
non-scraped, bad-sector and finished.

Ddrescue now shows the percentage of the domain rescued in rescue mode.

The mapfile is now "fsync'ed" every 5 minutes because some systems seem
to never write the mapfile to disc.
