Changes in version 1.17:

The option "--sector-size" has been added as a synonym of "--block-size".

Ddrescue now terminates with an error if an unexpected EOF would discard
any successfully read data, just as it does when the input file
disappears from /dev.

Ddrescue now removes the last block from the logfile if it starts at the
end of the input file and is not marked as finished. This automatically
adjusts the logfile to shrinking input devices, like CD-ROMs written in
Track-At-Once mode.

A bug has been fixed that prevented status to update after system clock
had been put back.

Control-C no more overwrites status message.

Generate mode no more requires the "--force" option when outfile is not
a regular file.

The new chapter "Using ddrescue safely" has been added to the manual.

The target "install-bin" has been added to the Makefile.
